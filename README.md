## Learning C++ via the implementation of various feed-forward NNs.

### Todo:
- implement various training algorithms (SGD, Adam, etc.)
- test mnist accuracy
- implement various matrix multiplication optimisations
- implement various neural network architechtures (LSTMs, RNNs for financial data; CNN for some image data)
